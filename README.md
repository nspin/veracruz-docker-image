# Building Veracruz

<img src = "https://confidentialcomputing.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/85/2019/08/cc_consortium-color.svg" width=192>

This is the repository for the Docker container used for developing Veracruz.
Veracruz is an open-source runtime for collaborative privacy-preserving compute.
The main Veracruz repository can be found [here](https://github.com/veracruz-project/veracruz).

Veracruz is an adopted project of the Confidential Compute Consortium (CCC).

## Supported platforms

- Intel SGX
- Arm TrustZone
- [IceCap](https://gitlab.com/arm-research/security/icecap/icecap)

## Requirements

- **Docker:** 
We use Docker to provide a consistent build environment.  Follow this guide to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) if necessary.
- **Enable Docker squash experimental feature:** *The tests are done on a linux machine. [To enable docker experimental features on another OS.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/checkpoint_create/)*
We use the `squash` docker experimental feature to help reduce the Veracruz docker image size, to enable this feature:
    - run: 
        ```sh 
        sudo service docker stop
        ```
    - copy the following in `/etc/docker/daemon.json `
        ```sh
        {
            "experimental": true
        }
        ```
    - run:
        ```sh 
        sudo service docker start
        ```

- **Intel Attestation Service access token (IAS_Token)** *Only if building on an Intel platform:* 
You can get this token by following these steps: 
    - Create an account [here](https://api.portal.trustedservices.intel.com/EPID-attestation)
    - Once Signed in, under `Development Access`, select either `Subscribe (linkable)` or `Subscribe (unlinkable)` then `subscribe`.
    - Two keys will be generated, Primary and Secondary key, either of these keys can be used as your `IAS_Token`.


## Local build setup

Once all the necessary requirements are available, run the following commands:
- Clone the Veracruz repository: This will pull the docker submodule

    ```
    git clone --recursive git@github.com:veracruz-project/veracruz.git 
    export VERACRUZ_ROOT=$PWD/veracruz
    ```
- Once you have a local copy of the Veracruz source:

    ```
    cd veracruz/docker
    ```

The following instructions depend on the platform you're building for. (SGX, Arm TZ)

Note that building the Docker image will take a long time (we appreciate any suggestions on how this can be sped up!)

- ### Build Instructions for SGX
    ```
    make sgx TEE=sgx IAS_TOKEN=<your Intel Attestation Service token>
    ```
- ### Build Instructions for Arm TrustZone
    ```
    make tz TEE=tz
    ```

- ### Build Instructions for IceCap
    ```
    make icecap TEE=icecap
    ```

Once the image build process has finished, there should be a Docker container running called "veracruz". To verify that it's running, run: 
    ```
    docker ps
    ```
    
You can now start a shell in the newly created container:

```
docker exec -u <your username> -it 'veracruz' bash
```

## Test Instructions for SGX

You can manually build Veracruz by running:

```
source /work/veracruz/sgx_env.sh

cd /work/veracruz/runtime-manager/
make

cd /work/veracruz/veracruz-server/
make
```

With that, all major sub-components of Veracruz (including the SDK) will be built for SGX.

Now, to run the Veracruz server tests.  Simply run:

```
cd /work/veracruz
make sgx-veracruz-server-test
```

You should see that all (_7_) tests pass.  Now, to run the full system
integration tests:

```
make sgx-veracruz-test
```

All (_8_) tests should pass.

## Test Instructions for TrustZone

Once inside the container, setup your local environment:

```
cd /work/rust-optee-trustzone-sdk/
source environment
source $CARGO_HOME/env
```

Now that your environment is set up, build the enclave binary by executing the `trustzone` build target in the root directory of Veracruz:

```
make trustzone
```

Everything is now built for TrustZone, and the Veracruz server and Veracruz integration tests can now be run:

```
make trustzone-veracruz-server-test
```

and

```
make trustzone-veracruz-test
```

will execute both of these testsuites.  You, again, should see _7_ and _8_ tests executing and passing, respectively.

## Test Instructions for IceCap

Once inside the container, execute the following to build, start, and enter a
QEMU virtual machine running IceCap with the Veracruz test suites:

```sh
cd /work/veracruz/icecap
make test-system
./result/run
```

Inside the virtual machine's shell, execute the following to run the test
suites:

```sh
run_test veracruz-server-test
run_test veracruz-test
```

# Cleaning a build

The Veracruz Makefile exposes a build target, `clean`, which recursively
invokes `cargo clean` for each major subcomponent of the project.  However,
sometimes this is not enough to fix a broken build environment (note that this
is common when using `xargo` to build e.g. the examples, or the rest of the
SDK).  In that case, it is useful to also delete the contents of the
`~/.xargo` directory, in addition to the standard clean build process described
above.

# What to do when your kernel version changes

Note: All of the commands below need to be run on the host operating system,
not inside a Docker container.

When your Linux kernel gets updated, it does not update the SGX kernel module
with it, and therefore this needs to be rebuilt and reinstalled.  You can tell
when this has happened by running:

```
sudo lsmod | grep sgx
```

If you get no results, you need to reinstall the SGX kernel module.

Following the directions for installing the module for your new kernel from
here: https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx-driver.

Rebuild the linux-sgx-driver by running make, then:

```
sudo mkdir -p "/lib/modules/"`uname -r`"/kernel/drivers/intel/sgx"
sudo cp isgx.ko "/lib/modules/"`uname -r`"/kernel/drivers/intel/sgx"
sudo /sbin/depmod
sudo /sbin/modprobe isgx
```

# Generating the certificates

Cryptographic certificates can be generated by using the following `openssl`
invocation:

```
openssl req -new -x509 -key <key filename> -sha256 -nodes -days 3650 -out <certificate filename> -config cert.conf 
```
